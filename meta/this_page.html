<h1>How I made this page</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Anyone who has ever dabbled in HTML is probably aware that to make even a basic
page you need a lot of boilerplate: The tags are lengthy and getting even just
the header set up requires multiple lines of code. Engineers, however, are
extremely lazy: If you present them with a problem that is mere busy work, they
will rather invest multiple hours into an optimized and streamlined process
instead of taking slightly longer to write the boilerplate. All this was a 
roundabout way saying that I wanted to find a nice and easy way to concentrate
on actually writing for my blog, and not having to create so much boilerplate.</p>

<h2>Making the writing process sufferable</h2>

<p>If you've ever been to a GitHub or GitLab repository, or managed a few
yourself, you might have noticed those mysterious <code>README.md</code> files. the <code>md</code>
stands for Markdown, a markup language designed to quickly format texts without
all the boilerplate from HTML. Its extreme simplicity allows for fast typing,
however, you are quite restricted in styling your files. For example, you can't
make index tabs, put background images into your pages or stylize the text by
exchanging fonts mid text or coloring it. It is good enough for READMEs or
other texts that don't require a lot of stylization.</p>

<p>Markdown is in fact the main language in which these pages are written,
however, it is not HTML and thus (most likely) not readable by your web
browser, and I also lose a lot of the amenities aforementioned. If I wanted to
create a good looking blog though, I needed to find some way to turn my
Markdown into HTML.</p>

<h2>Turning Markdown into Markup</h2>

<p>As standards go, Markdown is extremely small, featuring only a few formatting
options. This includes <code>#</code>, <code>##</code> and <code>###</code> for headers, <code>**bold**</code>,
<code>*italics*</code> and <code>~~strike through~~</code> among other things. I <em>could</em> have written
my own script turning Markdown into HTML, but again, engineers are lazy. Lucky
for me, there was a tool: It's called <code>markdown</code>. It takes as an input a 
Markdown text and prints out the equivalent HTML code. That's the main body
taken care of, but it doesn't generate the rest of the boilerplate html code
like the header, or the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tags. Sadly, neither Markdown the
language nor <code>markdown</code> the tool had any options for including one file in
another. In the spirit of eliminating boilerplate though, I was determined.</p>

<h2>Eliminating the boilerplate</h2>

<p>Fellow C programmers might know about the glorious C Preprocessor. Its central
role is in eliminating a lot of boilerplate by declaring functions that another
file might want to use. The best thing about it is that it doesn't really care
what the actual contents of the source files are. It only cares about 
preprocessor directives placed inside that file. The plan was to include
templates by using the appropriate directive and passing it through the
preprocessor, however, there were always some preceding lines of the form
<code># n "some text"...</code>. Aside from just being weird to see, in Markdown, a
<code># text</code> is a Level 1 heading, not good.</p>

<p>So I was faced with a choice: Sanitize the output, meaning I get rid of any
erroneous lines, or I could write my own preprocessor. While the latter would
saved me from this awful rabbit hole, the former one sounded more fun, and I
plain liked the idea of using the C preprocessor in cursed ways nobody
intended to. It would also allow me to do more advanced things, like replacing
any occurrence of a word with a Wikipedia link to that word, or a glossary link.
Sadly, using the C preprocessor had proven to be overkill. The only use I could
find was using it in conjunction with a macro to get the title of the page into
the header of the HTML code. </p>

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

<p>Finally, to put all the pieces together, I use the tool Make from the Free
Software Foundation, Inc. to splice together the head, body and foot. At the
time I'm writing this, it's all the tool really does, but I have plans to also
add a feature that allows me to do the aforementioned glossary link stuff, and
maybe other things that come to mind.</p>
