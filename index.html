<h1>Keheck's Blog</h1>

<p>Welcome to my website, stranger! I am Keheck, aspiring computer engineer and
part of the infamous furry community. I was born in early 2004 and live in
Germany. On this site, I write about my endeavors into all kinds of coding
projects, be it silly things, experiments or actually useful code.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Anyone has a story of how they found their passion for whatever profession they
are pursuing or practicing. Sadly, my memory is very shoddy, and it's hard to
construct a clear timeline from what I do remember. A lot of projects,
especially the early ones, haven't survived either. I also tend to ramble on
instead of putting everything into a coherent story, so brace yourself.</p>

<h3>From humble beginnings</h3>

<p>As all great stories, mine began with Minecraft. My first arguable beginnings
in software development were the command blocks in Minecraft. For the
uninitiated, Minecraft is a block-based sandbox survival game, and command
blocks are special blocks available only in Creative Mode. They are often used
in Adventure Maps, which are user created worlds that guide the player along a
predetermined path. Command blocks are very ubiqutous in these maps, adding
functionality to the game and ensuring the player stays on the path.</p>

<p>The one map that really unlocked my passion for programming was undeniably the
The Code series of adventure maps. I highly advise any Minecraft player who
likes adventures and puzzles to play The Code. It's a 3 part series without a
real story, but they are fun and use command blocks like nothing else that I've
seen.</p>

<p>Long story short, these maps wanted me to dabble with command blocks as well,
as I used them for inspiration and just to figure out how command blocks worked
in detail. They eventually led me to find SethBling, who sparked the interest
in hardware programming in me by hacking Super Mario World to upload and
execute arbitrary code to play snake or pong.</p>

<h3>Shit gets real</h3>

<p>The initial fix of command blocks wasn't enough eventually and I needed harder
stuff. Naturally, modding the game itself was the next step. Modding Minecraft
taught me a few things about how computers worked in general. Modding was the
real gateway into programming, initially in Java, later adding C# and then
Python to the list of languages I was working with. While I rarely ever
really finished a project, the most important thing was that I learned
something, and that I did in spades.</p>

<p>Eventually I got a starter kit for programming with an Arduino, a small
microcontroller, and a few components like LEDs, a buzzer, LCD display and
other bibs and bobs. The kit came with a manual containing 10 projects,
explaining each component and showing what you can do with them, starting with
an LED that blinks, to making a traffic light and eventually programming an LCD
together with a buzzer and array of buttons to create a keyboard which can play
music. Sadly, the company seems to have shut down silently, as the website is
longer available.</p>

<p>I also found my way to the Unity Game Engine, where I got to experiment with
shaders. As per usual, I haven't many finished projects with it, but I have
taken part in two GameJams, and anything I've done with Unity has taught me
little things about game creation.</p>

<h3>What now?</h3>

<p>As of writing this, I am 20 years old now. I'm going to college to study
computer engineering, which combines the two practices of hardware creation
and software development. A computer engineer would for example design the
circuit boards for a new GPU and develop the driver so your operating system
can talk to it.</p>

<p>I am skilled in most languages, including Java, C#, C and Python. I know about
a lot of software development concepts like APIs, libraries, compilers, OOP and
all that jazz. The learning process is far from over though! Software
development is a vast field. I wonder where my next project will lead me...</p>
